## Environmental Impact

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The prevailing attitude of colonial-settlers around the turn of the twentieth century saw urban development and the taming of nature as the unquestioned goals of a progressive, modern society, which both fueled and justified their moves towards mass deforestation and logging, as well as factory development that resulted in air and water pollution. Max Liboiron reminds us that settlers’ lack of responsible custodianship upon the land is inextricably tied to the treatment of the peoples indigenous to those lands. “Canada’s extraction economy” he says, “from fur to fossil fuels – has been at the forefront of Canadian disruptions to Indigenous Land and self-determination. The pollution from extraction, as well as from refining, manufacturing, and other industries, is often concentrated in Indigenous communities, becoming a form of intergenerational violence.” <br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Leona Sparrow also explains the impact of colonization of indigenous lands: “Europeans took this land over and over and over, until we were cornered in this little spot. It’s been decimating in terms of access to territory. A lot of restrictions were enforced through the Indian Act and through being a part of the City of Vancouver without choice, without consultation. That’s been pretty traumatic for the community.”<br><br>
Cole Harris explains more broadly the outlook that many indigenous peoples held in regard to the environment, and how different that would have been at that time from the worldview held by colonial settlers:<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">"Economy and society were not separate categories, nor was the environment. People lived in familiar places, named them intimately, knew the seasonal ways of flora and fauna…. Subsequent inhabitants of the region would not begin to match this detailed, localized knowledge of a natural world. Nor would they know its spirits. The Native peoples of the Lower Mainland drew no distinction between mind and matter, animate and inanimate, human and natural, subject and object – categories of the modern European mind.”</p><br>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The images in this section portray settler-colonialists’ careless attitudes towards custodianship of the natural environment. In doing so, the images also remind us of the extent to which neither the lands nor indigenous peoples’ relationships to the lands were adequately considered or respected.<br>

  Top-left: A snowy field filled with hundreds of logs lying on their side in the foreground. In the background, a logging mill can be seen, among other buildings.<br>

  Bottom: View of logs coming down the river. In the background, logged areas on the bank of the river can be seen, with other trees still standing in the far background.</small></center><br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">One important consideration is the fact that not only was mass logging taking place in British Columbia at that time, but the fact that these photographs depicting sprawling landscapes of felled trees exist perhaps indicates public demand for evidence of such activities. Photographers wanted to document the process by which forests were cut down in the service of creating a city. One can imagine how average settlers at that time might have enjoyed seeing evidence of the “modernization” of the land that they had overtaken.<br>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">While the prevailing attitude of colonial-settlers was one which enabled them to justify a colonial takeover of indigenous lands, as well as mass logging, mining, and other activities to rob the land of precious resources, not everyone was entirely comfortable buying into the fairy tale that these activities were natural and inevitable steps forward in the progress of humankind’s domination over nature. Colonel Moody said of the land at New Westminster, it was “magnificent beyond description…. I declare without the least sentimentality, I grieve and mourn the ruthless destruction of these most glorious trees. What a grand old park this whole hill would make.” <br><br>

      This image portrays a cedar being felled in North Vancouver in 1896. According to the caption on the postcard, this tree was the largest recorded tree in British Columbia at that time, with a diameter of twenty-two feet. The image is a postcard, which means that the photograph was specifically designed to be sent abroad, conveying a certain triumphant attitude with which settlers showed friends and relatives how settler society was “taming” the lands in and around Vancouver.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Just as this image stands as evidence of colonial-settler disrespect for the land, it also represents disrespect for indigenous peoples, as the cedar tree in particular “plays an integral role in the spiritual beliefs and ceremonial life of coastal First Nations…. The deep respect for cedar is a rich tradition that spans thousands of years and continues to be culturally, spiritually, and economically important.”  The choice to not only fell such a tree but also photograph the event for the purposes of circulation therefore indicates an ignorance of indigenous cultures at best, and at worst a complete disregard and apathy for what those cultures considered sacred.<br><br>

  Top-left: View of the Princess Charlotte steamer ship leaving Vancouver for Victoria.<br>
  Top-right: View of the St. George, North Vancouver ferry No. 2. Written on photograph: No. 47.<br>
  Bottom: View of a steamer leaving Nanaimo, spewing smoke. The town can be seen in the background.</small></center><br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">These images portray the types of boats that settlers introduced into the area. While the first image was a larger ship that would have undertaken trips of longer duration to more distant places, the latter two images depict, respectively, the North Vancouver ferry (now known as the Seabus) and the ferry that travelled between Vancouver and Nanaimo. Both of those ships would have made their journeys at least once a day. All three images show us how much air and water pollution each vessel caused in the single instant it took for the photographs to be captured, and one can therefore imagine how much pollution would have resulted from daily passages of each ship. Far from addressing environmental concerns, each image seems to praise the ships as evidence of the modernization of Vancouver society.<br><br>

      Similarly to photographs portraying steamboats, this photograph of a paper mill in Ocean Falls would have provided settlers with evidence of the ways in which the recently-acquired lands of B.C. were being put to use in cultivating industries such as papermaking, which would help vault B.C. into the modern world. At the time, environmental concerns were not being widely considered among the settler community, and an image such as this would have been an object more of pride than of concern. <br><br>

In the distance, fumes from an array of smokestacks can be seen wafting into the air and blurring the view of the mountains at the horizon. The entire sky seems hazy, so that one cannot quite tell how much of the haze is caused by cloud and how much by pollution.<br><br>

      This image depicts a wide open area in which hundreds of sacks of coal have been stacked. Similar to other photographs in this exhibition which display a wide shot of an open area full of, for example, dozens of felled trees, this image similarly uses a wide shot to show viewers the sheer scope of the operation at hand. At the time, when industrialization was the goal, such an image might have seemed like evidence of progress. Today, it may be difficult to look at the image without thinking about the negative impact that colonization had on the natural environment.<br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The issue of settlers not appropriately considering indigenous rights to land and water is one that continues to be relevant today. During the curation of this exhibition, individuals from the Mikmaq nation were being harassed by settlers on the east coast of Canada for trying to exercise their fishing rights. Unlike many similar events throughout Canadian history, this battle ended in success for the Mikmaq, wherein several communities were able to come together to purchase a huge stake in the Clearwater fishing company, thereby giving legal heft to their right to fish. <br><br>
