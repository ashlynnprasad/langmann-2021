## Environmental Impact

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The prevailing attitude of colonial-settlers around the turn of the twentieth century saw urban development and the taming of nature as the unquestioned goals of a progressive, modern society. This ethos both fueled and justified their moves towards logging and mass deforestation, as well as factory development that resulted in air and water pollution. Max Liboiron, a Métis/Michif leader in anticolonial research methods, discusses how settlers’ lack of responsible custodianship of the land is inextricably tied to the treatment of the peoples indigenous to those lands. “Canada’s extraction economy” they say, “from fur to fossil fuels – has been at the forefront of Canadian disruptions to Indigenous Land and self-determination. The pollution from extraction, as well as from refining, manufacturing, and other industries, is often concentrated in Indigenous communities, becoming a form of intergenerational violence.”<sup>1</sup><br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Leona Sparrow, the director of Treaty, Lands and Resources for the <a href="https://www.musqueam.bc.ca/">Musqueam Indian Band</a>, also explains the impact of colonization of indigenous lands: “Europeans took this land over and over and over, until we were cornered in this little spot. It’s been decimating in terms of access to territory. A lot of restrictions were enforced through the Indian Act and through being a part of the City of Vancouver without choice, without consultation. That’s been pretty traumatic for the community.”<sup>2</sup><br><br>
<a href="https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/first-nation-relationship-to-the-land">Musqueam Indigenous Corporate Training, Inc.</a> explains the depth of the connection between indigenous peoples and the land.<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Since time immemorial, First Nations have had an intricate, respectful, spiritually and physically dependent, grateful, and protective tie to the land. The nature of this tie is not so much one of ownership but one of stewardship. They feel they have been bestowed with a responsibility for the land (and sea) and all of the creatures that inhabit the land with them. This sense of responsibility is greater than an emotional tie – it is intrinsically tied to the spirits of all aspects of the earth. Traditional knowledge, languages, cultural practices and oral traditions built up over the millennia are all connected to the land. If that connection, that umbilical cord, is severed then the spiritual well-being of the affected First Nation is at stake.<sup>3</sup></p><br>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The images in this section portray settler-colonialists’ attitudes towards custodianship of the natural environment. For them, there was no consideration, respect or understanding of indigenous peoples’ relationships to the land. Control, modernization, and exploitation were the main factors in the Colonial project, and any competing views were systematically erased through policies of white supremacy.<br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Not only was mass logging taking place in British Columbia, but the existence of photographs such as these indicates that there may have been public demand for evidence of such activities. Photographers wanted to document the process of deforestation in the service of creating a city, or for the creation of an economic infrastructure based on resource extraction and exploitation. One can imagine how average settlers might have enjoyed seeing evidence of the “modernization” of the land they had overtaken.<br>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">While the prevailing attitude of settlers was one that enabled them to justify a colonial takeover of indigenous lands, as well as mass logging, mining, and other activities to rob the land of precious resources, not everyone was entirely comfortable accepting this narrative. Colonel Moody, the first Lieutenant-Governor of British Columbia, declared of the land at New Westminster: it was “magnificent beyond description…. I declare without the least sentimentality, I grieve and mourn the ruthless destruction of these most glorious trees. What a grand old park this whole hill would make.”<sup>4</sup><br><br>

      <br>This postcard portrays the process of felling a cedar in North Vancouver in 1896. According to the caption, this tree was the largest recorded in British Columbia at that time, with a diameter of twenty-two feet. The image is a postcard, specifically designed to be sent abroad, conveying a certain triumphant attitude with which settlers showed friends and relatives how settler society was “taming” the lands in and around Vancouver.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Just as this image stands as evidence of colonial-settler disrespect for the land, it also represents a casual disregard for indigenous peoples, as the cedar tree in particular “plays an integral role in the spiritual beliefs and ceremonial life of coastal First Nations,” as explained by <a href="https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/cedar/">UBC’s Indigenous Foundations</a> resource. “The deep respect for cedar is a rich tradition that spans thousands of years and continues to be culturally, spiritually, and economically important.”<sup>5</sup><br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">These images portray the types of boats that settlers introduced into the area. The first image is a larger ship that would undertake trips of longer duration to more distant locations, and the latter two photographs depict, respectively, the North Vancouver ferry (now known as the Seabus) and the ferry that travelled between Vancouver and Nanaimo. Both ships would have made their journeys at least once a day. All three images demonstrate how much air and water pollution each vessel produced in the single instant it took to capture the photographs. From this, we can imagine how much pollution would have resulted from daily passages of each ship. Far from addressing environmental concerns, as contemporary viewers might be more likely to do, each image seems to praise the ships as evidence of the modernization of Vancouver society.<br><br>

      <br>Similarly, this photograph of a paper mill in Ocean Falls would have provided settlers with evidence of the way acquired lands in the Province were cultivated for industries such as papermaking, which would help vault B.C. into the modern world. At the time, environmental concerns were not being widely considered among the settler community, and an image such as this would have been an object more of pride than of concern.

In the distance, fumes from an array of smokestacks are seen wafting into the air and blurring the view of the mountains at the horizon. The entire sky seems hazy, so that one cannot quite tell how much of the haze is cloud and how much pollution.<br><br>

      <br><br>This image shows the scope of a mining operation in Ladysmith, B.C. The photographer has used a wide-angle shot to give viewers an impression of how much coal the mine has produced. This photographic tactic is similar to one that photographers employed to depict mass deforestation in several of the images above.

<big>Modern Impacts</big>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The issue of settlers not appropriately considering indigenous rights to land and water is one that continues to be relevant today. For example, settlers recently harassed Mi’kmaq Nation fishers on the east coast of Canada for exercising their traditional fishing rights. Unlike similar incidents throughout Canadian history, this battle ended in success for the Mi’kmaq, wherein several communities were able to come together to purchase a controlling stake in the Clearwater fishing company, thereby legally strengthening their traditional right to fish.<sup>6</sup><br><br>
  Similar battles for land and water rights have been occurring across the country for many years. In British Columbia earlier this year, tensions between the Wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governments came to a head over a proposed gas pipeline, commissioned by Coastal GasLink, to be laid in unceded indigenous territories.<sup>7</sup> When the pipeline was approved by the B.C. Supreme Court, mass protests broke out across the country, and continued on Wet’suwet’en territory, in support of indigenous people’s rights to refuse access to their lands.<sup>8</sup> As of the creation of this exhibition, work on the pipeline has gone ahead in spite of those protests and the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup>9</sup>
