## Environmental Impact

The prevailing attitude of colonial-settlers around the turn of the twentieth century saw urban development and the taming of nature as the unquestioned goals of a progressive, modern society, which both fueled and justified their moves towards mass deforestation and logging, as well as factory development that resulted in air and water pollution. Max Liboiron reminds us that settlers’ lack of responsible custodianship upon the land is inextricably tied to the treatment of the peoples indigenous to those lands. “Canada’s extraction economy” he says, “from fur to fossil fuels – has been at the forefront of Canadian disruptions to Indigenous Land and self-determination. The pollution from extraction, as well as from refining, manufacturing, and other industries, is often concentrated in Indigenous communities, becoming a form of intergenerational violence.” <br><br>

Leona Sparrow also explains the impact of colonization of indigenous lands: “Europeans took this land over and over and over, until we were cornered in this little spot. It’s been decimating in terms of access to territory. A lot of restrictions were enforced through the Indian Act and through being a part of the City of Vancouver without choice, without consultation. That’s been pretty traumatic for the community.”<br><br>
Cole Harris explains more broadly the outlook that many indigenous peoples held in regard to the environment, and how different that would have been at that time from the worldview held by colonial settlers:<br>
Economy and society were not separate categories, nor was the environment. People lived in familiar places, named them intimately, knew the seasonal ways of flora and fauna…. Subsequent inhabitants of the region would not begin to match this detailed, localized knowledge of a natural world. Nor would they know its spirits. The Native peoples of the Lower Mainland drew no distinction between mind and matter, animate and inanimate, human and natural, subject and object – categories of the modern European mind.” <br><br>
The images in this section portray settler-colonialists’ careless attitudes towards custodianship of the natural environment. In doing so, the images also remind us of the extent to which neither the lands nor indigenous peoples’ relationships to the lands were adequately considered or respected.
