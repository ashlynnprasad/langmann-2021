## Note on Positionality

This exhibition was curated by Ashlynn Prasad, an Archives and Reference Assistant at UBC’s Rare Books and Special Collections. Ashlynn is a settler of South Asian heritage whose ancestors originally came from India and were brought to Fiji as indentured labourers of the British Empire. Her parents moved from Fiji to Blackfoot land and then Cree land in what is now known as Edmonton, Alberta, before she was born. <br><br>
Ashlynn was privileged to be born on and grow up on Coast Salish territory in what is now known as Surrey, British Columbia, before relocating to the traditional lands of the Tongva nation in what is now known as Southern California, and then later to Amah Mutsun territories in what is now known as Santa Cruz, California.  She returned to the Lower Mainland to complete graduate work at the University of British Columbia and was lucky to live, work, and study on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ speaking Musqueam peoples. While curating this exhibition, the University of British Columbia was closed due to COVID-19, and she worked remotely while living on the ancestral and unceded homelands of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ and Sḵwx̱wú7mesh speaking peoples. <br><br>
Rare Books and Special Collections, which houses the Uno Langmann Family Collection of B.C. Photographs, is located on UBC’s Vancouver campus, on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of the hən̓q̓əmin̓əm̓ speaking Musqueam peoples.

## Note on Terminology

This exhibition was created in the autumn of 2020 using as a reference point the Indigenous Peoples: Language Guidelines Version 2.0 created by the University of British Columbia in 2018.  We have used the guidelines outlined in this document to attempt to describe indigenous peoples, lands, and languages as accurately and respectfully as we can, while realizing that best practices for terminology are subject to change as time passes, and that this exhibition may itself be a relic of its time – complete with out-of-date, incorrect terminology – in the future.

<!--## About the Collection

<!--This site is generated using [`collectionbuilder-gh`](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

<!--- a CSV of collection metadata
<!--- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

<!--The base site features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital). 

<!--## About the About Page

<!--We want to make About pages exciting, and easy to build. 

<!--The CollectionBuilder about page features a narrowed column with its own (optional) menu, featured content, and some technical information. 

<!--To build one, a user writes in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and includes  content from the site, as well as typical [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) features like cards and modals, using code snippets like those detailed below. 

<!--(Each included file has several options, which are documented in the files themselves. I've given the content widths of 25% and 50% to save space, but you can feature the entire image or document.)
