## Urban Development

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">An important piece of the context surrounding the photographs in this section is the way in which settlers around the turn of the twentieth century viewed urban development and control of nature. As local Tyee journalist Jesse Donaldson explains in his article, <a href="https://thetyee.ca/Life/2013/09/27/Unnatural-History-of-Stanley-Park/">An Unnatural History of Stanley Park</a>, the prevailing philosophy of the time “considered the wilderness something to be tamed and cultured, an ‘improved’ version of nature manicured by human intervention.”<sup>1</sup> This “improvement” of nature was another part of the colonial fairy tale, as characterized by Paige Raibmon an associate professor of history at the University of British Columbia. Settlers had to tell themselves, and internalize, this narrative to justify their takeover of indigenous lands. They had to first believe the lands that became Vancouver were completely pure and unsettled before they took over, ignoring the societies that existed before and continued to exist after their arrival. Second, they had to believe urbanization and industrialization were positive steps towards progress, in order to view themselves as saviors rather than destroyers.<br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The fairy tale went one step further. Settlers wanted to create an example near the city of their control over nature, an urban park that would “transform the image of Vancouver to be more than just another boomtown.”<sup>2</sup> The area now known as Stanley Park became the chosen space to create this fantasy. However, some mental gymnastics were required to transform Stanley Park in the public imagination into an uncultivated landscape. The reality was that, far from being the “primeval forest” that settlers imagined it to be, the area had long been the site of a thriving populace of indigenous peoples.<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">“The Aboriginal presence on the peninsula was considerable on the eve of the imposition of Stanley Park in 1887. Whatever may have been the land’s official status, Aboriginal people still considered it their own. For some… it was a place of residence. For others, it served economic and spiritual purposes [including as a burial ground].”<sup>3</sup></p><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">This section of the exhibit features images that act as evidence of this colonial fairy tale, and depict how settlers chose to view their relationships to the lands they had taken over. It also showcases snapshots of the city, and the confidence and speed with which settlers developed the area into their idea of what a modern metropolis should be.<br><br>

      <br><br><br>Perhaps the best example of the colonial-settler attitude towards progress and urban development, this illustration for the Golden Jubilee features two versions of the Vancouver skyline, one before skyscrapers and buildings were erected, and one after. The juxtaposition of the two skylines, in addition to the adjectives used in the text, provide an example of settler values at that time.<br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">This image to the left, taken from Coal Harbour and looking toward Deadman’s Island sometime between 1891 and 1901, shows settlements along the shore of the island. The image to the right shows similar establishments on the other side of the park, at English Bay. When this area was transformed into Stanley Park, habitations such as these were destroyed and their residents forced to relocate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The historian Jean Barman, in her book Stanley Park’s Secret shares quotes from indigenous individuals who lived on these lands before their forced relocation. In one case, a man named August Jack shares his experience of his house literally being demolished while he was inside. The house was located on the site of a future road that would wrap around the perimeter of Stanley Park, and would have been similar to the houses pictured here.<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">“We was inside this house when the surveyors come along, and they chop the corner of our house when we was eating inside.”<sup>4</sup></p><br><br>

      This postcard is notable not only for the way it showcases the large buildings and paved roads of Vancouver’s newly-developed downtown area, as well as the parade which is apparently intended to show off the city, but also for the signage visible. One banner reads “A Hundred Thousand Welcomes,” in an example of settlers enthusiastically welcoming strangers to lands that were not rightfully theirs. In British Columbia, most of the land never came under the jurisdiction of treaties and remains unceded to this day.

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Another slightly more puzzling sign in the background reads “Just Watch Vancouver’s Smoke.” This could be an indication of the way in which industrialization was revered, and environmental impact was not yet the subject of widespread concern – at least not by settlers.<br><br>

 <p style="text-indent: 25px;">These triumphant aerial shots portray the sprawling, newly erected buildings of Vancouver’s downtown hub. However, not everyone was permitted to share in the perceived progress of the young city. By the time Vancouver was developing as a major city, indigenous peoples had already faced a long history of marginalization. Erin Hanson, in <a href="https://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/aboriginal_rights/">Aboriginal Rights</a>, notes:<br>
  <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">“Colonial governments in Canada initially practiced a policy of extinguishment, which meant that Aboriginal peoples’ rights would be surrendered or legislated away, often in exchange for treaty rights…. Over time, however, many Aboriginal people found that the Canadian state continued to subjugate them and infringe upon the very rights they thought would be respected…. For example, the government added specific pieces of discriminatory legislation in the Indian Act that made it illegal for Aboriginal people to organize politically or to hire legal counsel to further land claims.”<sup>5</sup> </p><br>
  <p style="text-indent: 25px;">In this way, indigenous peoples were forced to watch their traditional and ancestral homelands give way to settlements they were forcibly excluded from, such as those pictured above, while any power they had to seek redress were also stripped away. As noted by an unnamed source quoted in the Museum of Anthropology’s <a href="http://www2.moa.ubc.ca/musqueamteachingkit/history.php">Musqueam Teaching Kit</a>, “The government amended the Indian Act in 1927 making it illegal for us to hire lawyers and hold meetings to pursue land claims. Despite this injustice, First Nations worked together to form the Native Brotherhood of British Columbia and other political organizations to assert our Aboriginal rights.”<sup>6</sup><br><br>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Jordan Stanger-Ross, associate professor of history at the University of Victoria and director of the Landscapes of Injustice research project, discusses the idea that there has been a historical “opposition assumed between the civilization cities are imagined to represent, and the imagined savageness of Indigenous people…. There is an idea that the two can’t coexist.”<sup>7</sup> For this reason, when settlers designated lands for First Nations reserves, those lands were often not centrally located near developing urban hubs. “If you look at where reserves have been placed in this country, they’re largely on the outskirts,” says Ginger Gosnell-Myers of the Nisga’a and Kwakwak'awakw Nations, and Indigenous Relations Manager at the City of Vancouver. “That’s by design... we’re looking at a deliberate history of exclusion.”<sup>8</sup><br><br>

      Areas that had once been important and sacred places to indigenous peoples, including even burial grounds, were taken over and transformed into sites of leisure and social gathering for colonial settlers. This image portrays a busy day at Second Beach in Stanley Park, where settlers in suits and dresses walk, gather, and sun- and ocean-bathe. The tall trees of Stanley Park can be seen in the background.

      This image portrays a group of settler men laying cement for sidewalks in the rapidly developing urban hub now known as the Greater Vancouver Regional District. Few European settlers occupied the area until the 1850s, when New Westminster (now a suburb of Vancouver) was established. The area saw a further population increase in the 1860s when a gold rush attracted settlers to the Cariboo Mountains. Vancouver was not incorporated as a city until 1886.<sup>9</sup>

  <p style="text-indent: 25px;">This image demonstrates that the rapid development of the new city was largely carried out by settlers of European descent. The image, and the fact that someone made sure to photographically document the laying of cement, also gives us a sense of the pride that settlers took in their new city.<br><br>

      This postcard depicts the entrance to Stanley Park after construction had been completed. The image shows a carefully pruned lawn with flower boxes and sparse trees in the foreground, with the “wild” expanse of tall trees in the background. Individuals in suits and dresses – presumably settlers – can be seen walking along the promenade and stopping to chat with one another, while their cars stay parked to the left.
