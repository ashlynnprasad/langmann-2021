## Urban Development

An important piece of the context surrounding the photographs in this section is the fact that the prevailing mindset around the turn of the twentieth century saw urban development and the suppression of wilderness as progress, something to be desired and aimed for. As Jesse Donaldson explains in his article, “An Unnatural History of Stanley Park,” the prevailing philosophy of the time “considered the wilderness something to be tamed and cultured, an ‘improved’ version of nature manicured by human intervention.”  This “improvement” of nature was another part of the colonial fairy tale as described by Paige Raibmon; in order to justify their presence on indigenous lands, settlers had to convince themselves that they were helping to bring about a necessary and inevitable improvement.
