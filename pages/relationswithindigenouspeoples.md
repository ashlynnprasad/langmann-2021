## Relations with Indigenous Peoples

One of the most important factors to consider when browsing the Uno Langmann Collection of B.C. Photographs is the historical context that acts as a backdrop for the images. Part of the project of colonization required settlers to ignore the perspectives, wishes, and needs of indigenous peoples, and many of the images – which were taken by settlers – therefore ignore indigenous perspectives and histories. The previous two sections dealt with settler relationships to indigenous lands, both in terms of the way that they developed it once they had stolen it, and in terms of their disregard for environmental custodianship. Due to the nature of the relationships between indigenous peoples and their ancestral lands, a discussion of settler relationships to indigenous lands necessarily includes a discussion of settler relationships to indigenous peoples. However, this section moves away from ideas of land in particular in order to focus more broadly on the treatment of indigenous peoples, histories, traditions, and customs. The images in this section act as evidence for the relationship – or rather, lack of relationship – that settlers of the time had with the peoples who lands they had stolen.

      Another example of the ways in which settler-colonial preferences for the visual appeal of the park overrode entire histories of indigenous customs and land rights was the re-placement of Lumberman’s Arch. John Mackie explains how the arch was resituated from its original home downtown to Stanley Park, “on the site of an old native village that whites called Whoi Whoi,” or Xwayxway, and which had been home to Squamish, Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations.  Not only was it their home, but “when the first road was built around Stanley Park, a construction crew unearthed near Whoi Whoi a large deposit of broken and crushed clam shells, as well as skulls and other body parts.... Rather than exciting any interest, the shells were used to surface the road.” 
The focus remained on grooming Stanley Park to become a decoration to the city, where once it had been the site of a thriving indigenous population. A newspaper article at the time of the relocation of Lumberman’s Arch celebrated it as a “permanent advertisement of our lumber industries, a memento of the Royal visit and, artistically placed, a real ornament and appropriate addition to our beautiful park.”
