## Relations with Indigenous Peoples

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">One of the most important factors to consider when browsing the Uno Langmann Collection of B.C. Photographs is the historical context that acts as a backdrop for the images. Part of the project of colonization required settlers to ignore the perspectives, wishes, and needs of indigenous peoples, and many of the images – which were taken by settlers – therefore ignore indigenous perspectives and histories. The previous two sections dealt with settler relationships to indigenous lands, both in terms of the way that they developed it once they had stolen it, and in terms of their disregard for environmental custodianship. Due to the nature of the relationships between indigenous peoples and their ancestral lands, a discussion of settler relationships to indigenous lands necessarily includes a discussion of settler relationships to indigenous peoples. However, this section moves away from ideas of land in particular in order to focus more broadly on the treatment of indigenous peoples, histories, traditions, and customs. The images in this section act as evidence for the relationship – or rather, lack of relationship – that settlers of the time had with the peoples who lands they had stolen.<br><br>

      Another example of the ways in which settler-colonial preferences for the visual appeal of the park overrode entire histories of indigenous customs and land rights was the re-placement of Lumberman’s Arch. John Mackie explains how the arch was resituated from its original home downtown to Stanley Park, “on the site of an old native village that whites called Whoi Whoi,” or Xwayxway, and which had been home to Squamish, Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations.  Not only was it their home, but “when the first road was built around Stanley Park, a construction crew unearthed near Whoi Whoi a large deposit of broken and crushed clam shells, as well as skulls and other body parts.... Rather than exciting any interest, the shells were used to surface the road.”

<br><p style="text-indent: 25px;">The focus remained on grooming Stanley Park to become a decoration to the city, where once it had been the site of a thriving indigenous population. A newspaper article at the time of the relocation of Lumberman’s Arch celebrated it as a “permanent advertisement of our lumber industries, a memento of the Royal visit and, artistically placed, a real ornament and appropriate addition to our beautiful park.”<br><br>

      This image shows us another relic of the many past lives of Stanley Park, from a zoo which once existed there. As Jesse Donaldson of <a href="https://thetyee.ca/Life/2013/09/27/Unnatural-History-of-Stanley-Park/"><i>The Tyee</i></a> says, “Not only were plant species regularly added and replaced in the Stanley Park of the early 20th century; so too were members of the peninsula’s animal population” such as “animals kept in the park zoo (including several deer and a bear notable for its repeated escapes).”  The existence of such an attraction acts as yet another example of the ways in which the settlers of that time wished to craft a particular image of Stanley Park: full of nature, but only in ways that felt palatable and safe to settlers.

      This image is a further example of the ways in which settlers disrespected indigenous customs and traditions. When seen through a more critical lens, this image reads as evidence of the ways in which settlers not only took the land for their own, but then also proceeded to take advantage of natural resources in harmful and toxic ways. The handwritten captions on the photograph – “The cougar hunt” and “The cougar dead just where she fell” – speak to the enjoyment and pride that was taken in hunting for sport, rather than focusing on being more responsible, respectful custodians of the land.

     <br>This image is most notable for its illustration of George Vancouver, one of the first colonizers of the area that now bears his name. In the image, George Vancouver is seen in larger-than-life form, physically standing on the lands now known as Stanley Park. Vancouver’s arms are slightly raised and his feet positioned in a way that arguably conveys power and ownership. Whether intentionally or not, his raised arms somewhat mimic the “Salish tradition of welcoming visitors,” which also includes raised arms.

      An unnamed source in the Museum of Anthropology’s <a href="http://www2.moa.ubc.ca/musqueamteachingkit/history.php">Musqueam Teaching Kit</a> shares the impact that the residential school system had on indigenous peoples:<br>
      “When British Columbia entered Confederation in 1871, Aboriginal people were placed under federal jurisdiction. By 1876, the Indian Act legislated our daily lives. In an attempt to assimilate Aboriginal people to Christian Canadian society, the government sent our children to Indian residential schools. Despite these destructive policies, our culture and society persisted.” <br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">This image portrays an Indian residential school in Chilliwack, with the innocuous and euphemistic handwritten caption, “Coqualeetza Industrial School.” The residential school system is widely considered to be one of the greatest crimes perpetrated against indigenous peoples by the Canadian government, and indigenous families today are still grappling with the generational trauma that these institutions caused. More information can be found through the <a href="https://irshdc.ubc.ca/about/what-we-do/">Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre</a>, which aims to address this history from a Survivor-centred approach.<br><br><br>

      This image portrays a white settler child who has been dressed up in traditional indigenous clothing as a “mascot” for the Vancouver Golden Jubilee celebration. The image is particularly poignant when set up in conversation with the previous image of a residential school, since indigenous children in residential schools were frequently punished and abused for attempting to wear the traditional clothes or speak the traditional languages of their peoples. It is also worth noticing that the occasion for which this settler child was dressed up in indigenous clothing was an anniversary of the creation of the city of Vancouver, which of course was only possible because of settler subjugation of indigenous peoples.<br>
The use of indigenous peoples and imagery as “mascots” is an affront that continues to be perpetrated – and fought against by indigenous peoples across North America – today.<br><br>

      <br>This image portrays a play about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ performed by indigenous folks in front of an audience of white settlers. The context of the image, such as how and why this event came to pass, is unknown, but there is something striking about the image when one considers that Christianity was often forcibly foisted upon indigenous peoples and children in particular in order to both separate them from their cultural traditions and to offer another pathway by which settlers could justify colonization to themselves.<br>
