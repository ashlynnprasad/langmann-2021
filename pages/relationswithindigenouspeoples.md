## Relations with Indigenous Peoples

One of the most important factors to consider when browsing the Uno Langmann Collection of B.C. Photographs is the historical context that acts as a backdrop for the images. Part of the project of colonization required settlers to ignore the perspectives, wishes, and needs of indigenous peoples, and many of the images – which were taken by settlers – therefore ignore indigenous perspectives and histories. The previous two sections dealt with settler relationships to indigenous lands, both in terms of the way that they developed it once they had stolen it, and in terms of their disregard for environmental custodianship. Due to the nature of the relationships between indigenous peoples and their ancestral lands, a discussion of settler relationships to indigenous lands necessarily includes a discussion of settler relationships to indigenous peoples. However, this section moves away from ideas of land in particular in order to focus more broadly on the treatment of indigenous peoples, histories, traditions, and customs. The images in this section act as evidence for the relationship – or rather, lack of relationship – that settlers of the time had with the peoples who lands they had stolen.
